# Nate's Wordle Solver

## Overview

This is a hobby project in which I attempt to create an application that solves wordle puzzles optimally. Don't really know what form it'll take, but it sounds fun.

## Issues

1. Yellow and Gray letters need position tracking to avoid repeat guesses
1. Need support for multiple instances of single green char (can't use char as key in dict)
